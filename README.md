#  Movie Revenue Analysis with CRISP-DM

An exploratory data analysis project aimed at helping Microsoft Studios optimize movie investments. Using Python and the CRISP-DM framework, we uncover which release months, budget ranges, and film traits most influence profit outcomes.

---

##  Key Questions Explored
1. Which release months deliver the highest profit ratios?
2. What features are most strongly correlated with profitability?
3. How efficiently do films convert budgets into revenue?
4. What seasonal patterns or combinations of features signal high ROI?

---

##  Business Recommendations
-  Focus on **June and August** releases for stronger ROI performance.
-  Prioritize **mid-budget films** ($20M‚Äì$60M) to avoid overspending with low returns.
-  Invest in movies with runtimes between **100‚Äì120 mins** and themes in **Action or Drama**.
-  Use engineered metrics like `profit_ratio` to identify high-efficiency outliers.
